# English Learning Journey.

My English language learning path.

In this repository I would put the entire trajectory of my learning in English

- Courses.
- Books.
- Texts.
- Methods.
- Forms of translation.

I made the decision to put everything I practice, be it film, music and texts.
That's every day for 2 hours a day from 4 am to 6 am at the end I will do the comint to leave it registered.

I made the decision to learn the language because I wanted to live in [Holland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland)  in [Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam)
